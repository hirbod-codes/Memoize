/**
 * Last line of defense — NOT a substitute for proper try/catch or the
 * centralized Express error handler. Their only job is to guarantee
 * nothing is ever lost silently before the process goes down.
 *
 * uncaughtException / unhandledRejection mean the process is in an
 * unknown state (a genuine bug slipped past everything else). The
 * correct move is: log it with everything you have, stop accepting new
 * connections, let in-flight requests finish (bounded by a timeout),
 * then exit — and let Docker Swarm / PM2 / k8s restart the process clean.
 * Do NOT try to keep serving traffic after this fires.
